Wilder Wines on College Street earned a nod for its lambrusco spritz (the lower alcohol summer sipper with Castelvetrano olives over pebble ice), while La Reprise on Pine Street drew praise for its perfectly executed pastas and that tomato toast situation. The Wise Fool in the Old North End got the spotlight for its affordable Middle Eastern fare, particularly those cheese fatayer that sell out daily. And Stone Soup's Misty Knoll wings, following a recipe \"borrowed\" from the late Five Spice Café, were declared Burlington's best. Mr. Creemee's doughnut creemee sandwich also made the cut.

Here's the frustrating math: state funding kicks in only when wind chill hits negative 10 for four hours within a 24 hour period, meaning earlier cold snaps went without official shelter openings. City officials acknowledged this gap has already contributed to an overloaded emergency department at UVM Medical Center. The underlying issue remains a shortage of year round shelter beds, something officials say they're working with the state to address through longer term solutions."}, {"date": "12/26/2025", "title": "Drought This Summer Caused $18 Million in Damages to Vermont Farms", "url": "https://www.vermontpublic.org/local-news/2025-12-24/drought-summer-caused-18-million-damages-vermont-farms?utm_campaign=friday-december-26th&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=www.btownbrief.com", "content": "The drought did things to farmers that they're not used to, unlike flooding which often happens around the state.

Addison County took the hardest hit with roughly $1.4 million in damages across 25,000 acres. The timing is particularly rough for dairy farmers now heading into winter with depleted hay and feed corn supplies, forcing them to purchase animal feed at peak prices.

The cheaper fix (a $250,000 sidewalk improvement at lower Webster Road) will likely move forward, while the bridge remains a longer shot dependent on grant funding.

The city estimates it needs 56 new rental units added annually just to break even by 2038.

The most heated exchange centered on Food Not Cops' relocation to City Hall Park, with councilors split between those citing negative impacts and others arguing the city's playing whack-a-mole instead of addressing root causes. The \"City Circle\" restorative justice program proposal aims to fix our broken ticketing system by actually compelling engagement rather than just issuing fines that go unpaid. Meanwhile, the REIB office took a unanimous first step toward charter status, and renters finally got included in water bill assistance.
